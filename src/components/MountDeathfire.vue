 * Mount Deathfire — the great volcano of Nocturne, sitting behind every page.
 *
 * Built procedurally rather than drawn, so it costs nothing to ship and adapts
 * to any viewport: a basalt cone with a lit caldera, lava running down the
 * flanks, a plume of sparks off the summit, and ash falling through it all.
 *
 * The peak is deliberately set off-centre so it never sits directly behind the
 * centred hero wordmark, and the whole thing is anchored low — this is the
 * horizon of the world the site lives on, not the subject of the page.
 *
 * The landing page is the baked reference: fireTuning's DEFAULTS describe it
 * exactly. Every other route is a departure from it, declared as a profile of
 * bearing (where you stand), variance (how far the seeded detail strays) and
 * density (how loud the plume, ash and sky are). The hero's profile is
 * 0 / 1 / 1, which is neutral in every expression below — so `/` consumes the
 * identical sequence of seeded random numbers it did before profiles existed
 * and renders unchanged. Keep it that way when editing here.
